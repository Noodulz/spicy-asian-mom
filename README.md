# Spicy Asian Mom Bot
![apfp](/src/images/tigermommy.png)<br/>
A Discord bot simulating a traumatizing Asian tiger mom that aggressively tells you you're some kind of disappointment (or not) anytime a user mentions the word "study" or "studying". Developed with Discord.js and Node.js and currently deployed and up and running via by AWS (EC2).

Note that this was made purely out of a parodical idea and that I mean no offense or seriousness. This is purely a homage to all the Asian kids out there with aggressively strict parents. 

Feel free to make pull requests or submit an issue for any other phrases you'd like to be put into Spicy Asian Mom Bot! I'll gladly take more into consideration ;)
